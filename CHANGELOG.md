# Changelog

All notable changes to TBC Duck Analyzer are documented here.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **RP Encounter Buff Tracking** - Expanded the `combatantinfo` search window up to 3 minutes prior to combat start. Fixes a critical issue where long RP fights (e.g., Kael'thas) would discard all initial buffs and gear data on wipes.
- **In-Combat Consumables Tracker** - Added tracking for Super Mana Potions, Super Healing Potions, Injectors, and all types of Drums (Battle, Restoration, Speed, War, Panic) to ensure they appear under Consumables & Buffs when used mid-fight (especially post-resurrection).
- **Player Sorting Logic** - Upgraded the player sorting algorithm in the UI. Characters are now cleanly grouped by **Class**, then by **Specialization**, and finally sorted **Alphabetically**.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### ✨ Full-Stack Migration & Architecture
- **Node.js Integration** - Migrated to a Node.js express backend environment (`server.js`) replacing pure static configuration logic.
- **Local Proxy for Assets** - Server now intelligently intercepts, caches, and serves Wowhead icons via `/api/icon/` endpoints to radically reduce load times and bandwidth.
- **SQLite Database Integration** - Integrated `logs_cache` system directly into backend for persistent querying.
- **Docker Support** - Packaged backend application using `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for unified, consistent local testing and cloud environment rollouts.

### 🐛 Gear Inspector & Logic Fixes
- **Strict Enchant Validation Matrix** - Re-engineered enchantment tracking matrix. Prevents false-negative warnings on Neck, Shirt, Waist, Rings, Trinkets, and Ranged.
- **Enchant Priority Logic** - "❌ Slacking" warning now accurately respects the precedence of permanent enchants over temporary enchantments like oils or stones.
- **Off-hand Weapon Validation** - Reworked rules conditionally targeting item sub-types. Enchants strictly validated only when dealing with genuine shields or standard weapons.
- **UI Grid Perfection** - Addressed flexbox margin desyncs linking paperdoll spacing cleanly with armor container titles.
- **Console Debugs** - Silent debugging logs injected directly within iteration loop mapping exact equipment metadata visually.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### ✨ UI & Gear Inspector Redesign
- **Complete Gear Inspector Overhaul** - Expanded layout with a clean 2-column grid.
- **TBC Enchantment Details** - Automatic mapping of TBC Enchant IDs to readable names + localized stats.
- **Weapon Enchant Grouping** - Permanent enchants strictly excluded from consumables tracker.
- **Optimized Tooltips** - Deferred Wowhead tooltip loading (0 lag spike on inspect), strict CSS clipping, and prevented accidental hover on text.
- **Refined Paperdoll** - Responsive 2D stickman SVG mathematically bound to exact slot coordinates.
- **Hotkeys** - Added `Escape` key listener to seamlessly close all active overlays/modals.
