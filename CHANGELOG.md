# Changelog

All notable changes to TBC Duck Analyzer are documented here.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### ✨ Compare Logs & UI Improvements
- **Compare Logs Module** - Implemented a new "Compare Logs" functionality allowing side-by-side comparison of two logs.
- **Collapsible Sections** - Comparison table sections (Consumables, Buffs, Abilities & Spells) can now be collapsed for cleaner viewing.
- **Smart Spell Grouping** - Abilities in the comparison view are now intelligently sorted: Trinkets first, then Totems/Heroism, then Shocks, and finally remaining spells alphabetically.
- **Accurate Role Filtering** - Fixed an issue where the role filter (e.g. "Healer") incorrectly matched all players of certain classes regardless of their actual talent spec.
- **Curse Uptime Mapping** - Added normalization logic to correctly match WCL's "Curse Elements" and "Curse Recklessness" with internal database names to accurately calculate debuff uptime.
- **Sapper Tracking** - Reclassified TBC Sappers from generic "Abilities" into the "Consumables" section for better logical grouping.
- **Timeline UI Tweaks** - Improved the timeline visuals by removing background boxes to make them blend seamlessly, and implemented synchronized scrolling logic for side-by-side comparison.


## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-30

### ✨ Full-Stack Migration & Architecture
- **Node.js Express Backend** - Migrated to a Node.js express backend (`server.js`) replacing pure static HTML structure.
- **SQLite Caching** - Integrated local SQLite database to securely cache GraphQL WCL requests, drastically reducing load times and API quota usage.
- **Environment Variables** - WCL credentials securely handled via `.env` files instead of client-side local storage.

### 🎨 Features & UI
- **Uptime & Timelines** - Added highly interactive Casts & Uptime tracking module.
- **Pre-Combat Buff Tracking** - Custom `combatantinfo` parser injects pre-combat buffs (e.g. Battle Shout, Totems) seamlessly into the timelines.
- **Sunder Armor & Devastate** - Implemented detailed tracking for Warrior armor debuffs and cast counts.
- **Windfury & Totem Tracking** - Combined Windfury ranks for clean timeline tracking, and enabled exact Rank 1 cast counting.
- **Engineering Tracking** - Added robust tracking for Dense Dynamite, Fel Iron Bombs, Sappers, and Adamantite Grenades.
- **Dynamic Fallbacks** - Smart fallback handling removes generic "Raid" or "Environment" timeline segments when real application events exist.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **RP Encounter Buff Tracking** - Expanded the `combatantinfo` search window up to 3 minutes prior to combat start. Fixes a critical issue where long RP fights (e.g., Kael'thas) would discard all initial buffs and gear data on wipes.
- **In-Combat Consumables Tracker** - Added tracking for Super Mana Potions, Super Healing Potions, Injectors, and all types of Drums (Battle, Restoration, Speed, War, Panic) to ensure they appear under Consumables & Buffs when used mid-fight (especially post-resurrection).
- **Player Sorting Logic** - Upgraded the player sorting algorithm in the UI. Characters are now cleanly grouped by **Class**, then by **Specialization**, and finally sorted **Alphabetically**.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### ✨ Full-Stack Migration & Architecture
- **Local Proxy for Assets** - Server now intelligently intercepts, caches, and serves Wowhead icons via `/api/icon/` endpoints to radically reduce load times and bandwidth.
- **Docker Support** - Packaged backend application using `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for unified, consistent local testing and cloud environment rollouts.

### 🐛 Gear Inspector & Logic Fixes
- **Strict Enchant Validation Matrix** - Re-engineered enchantment tracking matrix. Prevents false-negative warnings on Neck, Shirt, Waist, Rings, Trinkets, and Ranged.
- **Enchant Priority Logic** - "❌ Slacking" warning now accurately respects the precedence of permanent enchants over temporary enchantments like oils or stones.
- **Off-hand Weapon Validation** - Reworked rules conditionally targeting item sub-types. Enchants strictly validated only when dealing with genuine shields or standard weapons.
- **UI Grid Perfection** - Addressed flexbox margin desyncs linking paperdoll spacing cleanly with armor container titles.

- **TBC Enchantment Details** - Automatic mapping of TBC Enchant IDs to readable names + localized stats.

- **Refined Paperdoll** - Responsive 2D stickman SVG mathematically bound to exact slot coordinates.
- **Hotkeys** - Added `Escape` key listener to seamlessly close all active overlays/modals.
